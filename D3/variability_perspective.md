### D3: Variability Perspective

For your project, provide an analysis of evolution perspective in general, focusing on variability in particular.
To that end, conduct the following steps:

1. Identify a number (aim at around 20) of features that can be varied across different instances of your system. Give each feature a name, and describe key characteristics such as relevant stakeholders and its effect.

2. Identify relationships between the features identified, such as dependencies, conflicts, etc. (If all features you identified are independent, search a little harder, redoing the previous step).

3. Visualize the feature relationships in one (or more) feature model created through FeatureIDE.

4. Identify the binding time of the features. Are there features with different binding times (some at run time, others at compile time)?

5. Identify the strategy used to realize / implement the desired variability / configurability (design patterns, ifdefs, configuration files, etc)

6. Analyze the evolution history of the variability mechanism, and of configurable features. Identify issues and pull request that relate to the configurability of the system you study.

**Note** 

Any realistic system will possess variability. If you believe your system cannot be configured at all, contact the teachers (and you should focus on Rozanski and Woods evolution perspective in general).
