###System scope and Responsibilities
The system scope of let’s encrypt is:
helping ACME clients (web servers which need certificates) and ACME servers(i.e. certificate authorities (CAs)) to deal with request/response of digital certificates. i.e. The computers using TLS protocols need Digital Certificate from a CA to identify themselves.
And let’s encryption serves as a communicator between web servers and CAs.
