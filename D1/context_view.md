###System scope and Responsibilities
The system scope of let’s encrypt is:
helping ACME clients (web servers which need certificates) and ACME servers(i.e. certificate authorities (CAs)) to deal with request/response of digital certificates. i.e. The computers using TLS protocols need Digital Certificate from a CA to identify themselves.
And let’s encryption serves as a communicator between web servers and CAs.

###Entities, data and interfaces

####Entities
- ACME clients
- ACME servers

####Interfaces

Interfaces between ACME clients and letsencrypt: url and public key to apply a certificate.Certificates (generated by CA) delivering to ACME users
interfaces between ACME servers and letsencrypt: url and public key from the ACME clients. Certificates received from CA.


###Interaction scenario

Interaction between system and environment can be depicted as following scenarios:

1. If computer A (client) is communicating with computer B (webserver), and A need a digital certificate to certificates that A is really A (not some bad guys spoofing B) and the public key A sends to B is the real public key from A.
A can request a certificate from letsencrypt.
A send its public key to letsencrypt, then letsencrypt send this request to a CA. and CA will encrypt the public key as well as and some basic information of computer A (may be the name, url of A, the name and url of root CA) with the private key of CA.
Then CA returns the certificate to letsencrypty and letsencrypt deliver it to webserver (B).


2. B receive the certificate of A (the certificate is issued by let’s encrypt).
If B trust let’s encrypt or the root CA of let’s encrypt(that means that B has a public key of CA), B can decrypt the certificate and find that: first, A is really A.
And then, B can take out the public key of A inside the certificate and use it to decrypt message from A and encrypt message to A.
