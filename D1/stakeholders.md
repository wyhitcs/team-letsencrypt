#Stakeholders
In this section, stakeholders are classified into different groups according to the definitions given by Rozanski and Woods.

The developer team includes the people who technically contribute to the Let's Encrypt project. Because the project is built a short time before (Dec 3, 2015) and still in progress, developers may also do test and maintaining jobs. For example, ´bmw´ who develops the client also responds to issues or pull requests from others. Without doubt, the team is the core of whole project.
