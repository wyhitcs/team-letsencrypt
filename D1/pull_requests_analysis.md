Created by: [SwartzCr](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pulls/SwartzCr)


There used to be a bug that will cause letsencrypt-apache fail. The problem is post in issue #2308.
About the issue #2308, as of 0.3.0, letsencrypt_apache uses some of the test libraries from letsencrypt. However, they strip the tests and the testdata from the python-letsencrypt library during its build step to save space in the package and to prevent the distribution of unneeded files.This is a downstream bug.

### 6. Title: Parse IPv6 and IPv4 virtual host entries correctly [(\#1143)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/1143)

Created by:  TheBoegl
Commented on by: None

This pull request correctly splits IPv6 addresses into the host and port parts. This will work for normal IPv4 and IPv6 addresses appended by a port number as well es for IPv6 addresses without a port, which should be the normal IPv6 usage. It also adds test for virtual host configuration file, whether a reversed order, i.e. first an IPv6 entry followed by an IPv4 one, or an IPv6 address without a given port works correctly.

### 7. Title: No conflicting declarations [(\#2262)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2262)

Labels: nginx,security enhancements and ui/ux

This pull request fix issue[#574](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/574), [#921](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/921) and [#1743](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/1743). Firstly, it stops using the options-ssl-nginx.conf and instead reads it and adds the declarations directly.The reason for doing this is to stop potential conflicting declarations, and make it easier to deal with other requirements, such as providing the possibility of upgrading cipher suites. Secondly, it also changes the name of the session cache used.That means that even if an ssl_session_cache is defined at the http{} level, this cache will not conflict with it.

### 8. Title: Make argparse dependency unconditional. [(\#2249)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2249)

This pull request was about Arch linux packaging. It makes argparse dependency unconditional which can avoid a branch, giving bugs one fewer place to hide and can fix the bug of argparse. Only people manually installing the Python packages with pip will use these dependency declarations.
