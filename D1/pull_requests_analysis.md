### 3.Title: Fix apache2.2 redirect problems [(\#2489)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2489)

**Created by:** [SwartzCr](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pulls/SwartzCr)

**Description:** Solved a bug that would cause the letsencrypt-apache to fail. The problem was posted in the issue #2308. According to the issue #2308, letsencrypt_apache uses some of the test libraries from the letsencrypt. However, they strip the tests and the test data from the python-letsencrypt library during its build step to save space in the package and to prevent the distribution of the unneeded files. This is a downstream bug.

### 6.Title: Parse IPv6 and IPv4 virtual host entries correctly [(\#2478)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2478)

**Created by:**  [TheBoegl](https://github.com/TheBoegl)

**Commented on by:** None

**Description:** 1) Correctly split IPv6 addresses into the host and the port parts. This will work for the normal IPv4 and IPv6 addresses appended by a port number as well as for the IPv6 addresses without a port, which should be the normal IPv6 usage. 2) Added test for virtual host configuration file, which works correctly whether it is a reversed order or an IPv6 address without a given port.
