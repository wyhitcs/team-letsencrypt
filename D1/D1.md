Stakeholders
===========================
In this section, stakeholders are classified into different groups according to the definitions given by Rozanski and Woods. However, since the project is open-source and not completed, not all kinds of stakeholders are covered here. Besides, a short description is offered to give an overview of their jobs.

###Acquirers
- [Electonic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/)
- [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [University of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan)

The acquirer is the founder of the project who know and respond to the requirement of users. For Let's Encrypt, acquirers include educational and commercial foundations.

###Developers
- [Liam Marshall](https://github.com/ArchimedesPi)
- [bmw](https://github.com/bmw)
- [Felix Rieseberg](https://github.com/felixrieseberg)
- [Francois Marier](https://github.com/fmarier)
- [Harlan Lieberman-Berg](https://github.com/hlieberman)
- [Joona Hoikkala](https://github.com/joohoi)
- [Jacob Hoffman-Andrews](https://github.com/jsha)
- [Jakub Warmuz](https://github.com/kuba)

- [Peter Eckersley](https://github.com/pde)
- [Roland Bracewell Shoemaker](https://github.com/rolandshoemaker)
- [Sagi Kedmi](https://github.com/sagi)

The developer team includes the people who technically contribute to the Let's Encrypt project. Because the project is built a short time before (Dec 3, 2015) and still in progress, developers may also do test and maintaining jobs. For example, ´bmw´ who develops the client also responds to issues or pull requests from others. Without doubt, the team is the core of whole project.


###Users

The client is offered to the users who want to set up Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for their web server. Now a large number of websites tend to use the service offered by Let's Encrypt, such as Blueboard.cz, Checkdomain and Deep.ch.

###Sponsors
- [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/)
- [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com/)
- [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/)
- [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/)
- [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/)
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

Sponsors here means the financial support of the project. Because of the great use of the client in network, Let's Encrypt attracts large amount of commercial founders to investigate in the project.

###Additional Stakeholder
- [IdenTrust](https://www.identrust.com/) (Root certificate provider)

Let's Encrypt is a project about TLS encryption and CA certification. An organization is not able to provide CA service unless it is authorized by another qualified certificate authority.  IdenTrust is such a certificate authority and secure applications provider which issued Let's Encrypt root certificate.

Pull Request Analysis
===========================
### 1. Title: Allow users to choose how many config changes are shown[(\#2498)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2498)
**Created by:** [SwartzCr](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pulls/SwartzCr)

**Description:** Added a new parameter in *client.view_config_changes()* function so that the users could limit the number of lines shown in the command line. i.e. changing  from *client.view_config_changes(config)* to  *client.view_config_changes(config, num=config.num)*, with the parameter *config.num* used to specify the number of lines.

**Stakeholder:** Developers, users

### 2.Title: Print only challenge changes to configs [(\#2496)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2262)
**Created by:** [SwartzCr](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pulls/SwartzCr)

**Description:** Changed the logging of *reverter.view_config_changes()* and rewrote it in another way. This pull request is addressing the issue #2410. 
The issue #2410 is to solve the fact that *view_config_changes()* only displays permanent changes which are saved to a specific file but doesn’t display the temporary changes which will not be saved.

**Stakeholder:** Developers

### 3.Title: Fix apache2.2 redirect problems [(\#2489)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2489)

**Created by:** [SwartzCr](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pulls/SwartzCr)

**Description:** Solved a bug that would cause the letsencrypt-apache to fail. The problem was posted in the issue #2308. According to the issue #2308, letsencrypt_apache uses some of the test libraries from the letsencrypt. However, they strip the tests and the test data from the python-letsencrypt library during its build step to save space in the package and to prevent the distribution of the unneeded files. This is a downstream bug.

**Stakeholder:** Developers, Users

### 4. Title: Fix minor bootstrap problems[(\#2485)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2485)

**Created by:** [bmw](https://github.com/bmw)

**Description:** 1) Prevented the script from exiting if it needs to install OS packages. 2) Removed quotes around $SUDO from the *arch_common.sh* and the other bootstrap scripts.

**Stakeholder:** Developers

### 5.Title: Remove acme-challenge after cleaning up all challenges[(\#2480)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2480)
**Created by:** [filipochnik](https://github.com/filipochnik)

**Description:** 1) Added tests for cleaning up acme-challenge and refactor path logic in webroot plugin. After cleaning up all the challenges, the acme-challenge will be removed. 2) The response given by the developer gave another error about the travis failure. One more checking for the error code was added to solve the problem.

**StakeHolder:** Developers

### 6.Title: Parse IPv6 and IPv4 virtual host entries correctly [(\#2478)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2478)

**Created by:**  [TheBoegl](https://github.com/TheBoegl)

**Description:** 1) Correctly split IPv6 addresses into the host and the port parts. This will work for the normal IPv4 and IPv6 addresses appended by a port number as well as for the IPv6 addresses without a port, which should be the normal IPv6 usage. 2) Added test for virtual host configuration file, which works correctly whether it is a reversed order or an IPv6 address without a given port.

**StakeHolder:** Developers

###7.Title: No conflicting declarations [(\#2262)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2262)

**Created by:** [olabini](https://github.com/olabini)

**Description:** 1) Stopped using the options-ssl-nginx.conf but instead read it and added the declarations directly. The reason for doing this is to stop the potential conflicting declarations and make it easier to deal with the other requirements, such as providing the possibility of upgrading cipher suites. It also changes the name of the session cache used, which means that even if an *ssl_session_cache* is defined at the http{ } level, this cache will not conflict with it.

**StakeHolder:** Developers


###8. Title: Support system-default Apache on OS X. Tested on Yosemite (10.10).[(\#2449)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2449)

**Created by:** [nneonneo](https://github.com/nneonneo)

**Description:** Added a configuration for the Apache plugin in order to support OSX’s built-in Apache web server. However, it still needs users to enable SSL (including httpd-ssl.conf) and generate a snakeoil CA cert to support the DVSNI check. In addition, the user has to add a vhost configuration to */etc/apache2/other*.

**StakeHolder:** Developers, users

###9.Title: Make argparse dependency unconditional. [(\#2249)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2249)

**Created by:** [erikrose](https://github.com/erikrose)


**Description:** Made argparse dependency unconditional which can avoid a branch, giving the bugs one fewer place to hide and can fix the bug of argparse.This is about the Arch linux packaging and only people manually installing the Python packages with pip will use these dependency declarations.

**StakeHolder:** Developers, users

###10.Title: Added some standard apache2 modules that make tests fail.[(\#2105)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/2105)

**Created by:** [phispi](https://github.com/phispi)


**Description:** Letsencrypt failed on server when parsing the apache2.4 config. It turned out that the files where the error happens are standard apache2 modules. This pull request added the apache2 dav and the dav_svn modules that tests the failure on the server when parsing the apache2.4 config.

**StakeHolder:** Developers

Issue Analysis
===========================
###1. Title: Renewer should report failures via exit status [(\#2508)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2508)

**Description:** This issue proposes two things: 1) the *renew()* function should exit with a non-zero value if a renew of the certificate fails. It means there should be some feedback to the users/developers if the renew fails. 2) a “quiet” option should be added that, once it is used, there won’t be any status reported on the command line interface.

**Stakeholder:** Developers, users

###2. Title: Switch le-auto symlink to copy instead [(\#2501)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2501)

**Description:** The letsencrypt-auto symlink was turned at the root of the project into a copy of the letsencrypt-auto of the latest release. A line to the release script was added to copy the latest build to the root. Our instructions used to tell people to *git pull* and then run *le-auto* from the root. This will keep them from running a bleeding-edge master version and allow us to tiptoe less around changes to *le-auto* (double reviews, etc.).

**Stakeholder:** Users

###3. Title: Letsencrypt-auto fails with SSL error to pypi.python.org [(\#2499)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2499)
**Description:**
This issue reports a bug of *letsencrypt* that the letsencrypt throws an error while running for SSL process.The issue hasn’t been settled, but the comments proposed that it may be because of some function circumvent hash checking. The relevant functions may be *cryptography()*, *cffi()*, *set_requires()*.

**Stakeholder:**Users
###4. Title: Apache installer has trouble with missing vhost on renewal [(\#2491)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2491)

**Description:**
This is a bug may be related to vhost of letsencrypty. The comments says after fixing issue [(\#1991)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/1991), the problem is somehow reduced, but it still occassionaly happen when users install *letsencrypt* in their first time.

**Stakeholder:** Users

###5. Title: Apache plugin error: 'Error parsing variable' when envvars are used [(\#2481)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2481)

**Description:**
This issue reports a bug that when users use the command ./letsencrypt-auto --apache, they receive the following message:
>the apache plugin is not working; there may be problems with your existing configuration.

The error was PluginError (u'Error Parsing variable: ${INSTANCE\_ADDRESS}'). It looks like the plugin is not able to parse the env_var in the address field.
This issue is still open and there is not a solution yet.

**Stakeholder:** Users

###6. Title: Automatic upgrading in letsencrypt-auto downgrades to incompatible version [(\#2490)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2490)

**Description:**
This issue reports that the auto script *letsencrypt-auto-source/letsencrypt-auto* self-upgrades the current version to a downgrade incompatible version. This is because that  the auto script which simply checks if the versions are different. The problem is fixed in #2492 and this issue is closed.

**Stakeholder:** Developers, users

###7. Title: Fatal certlint error in recently signed certificate [(\#2463)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2463)
**Description:**
This issue is about a bug for the signed certificate. The log is
>FATAL: ASN.1 Error in X520CommonName and for more details, see:
https://crt.sh/?id=12791738&opt=cablint.

A reply to the issue mentions that he has addressed this problem in issue #2488 and it is not a client bug at all. For issue #2488, see https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/issues/1488.

**Stakeholder:** Users

###8. Title: webroot only verifies through port 80 [(\#2440)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2440)
**Description:**
This issue is about the webroot option. A user wanted to use port other than port 80 to be the webroot option of verification, since his port 80 is firewalled. It turns out that the Letsencrypt has already provided two other validation methods --- the SNI challenge (which can completely use a TLS listener on port 443) and the DNS challenge (which just requires being able to add records to your DNS zone).

**Stakeholder:** Users, developers

###9. Title: Letsencrypt certificate expiration notice [(\#2483)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2483)
**Description:**
This issue is about user experience. A user of *Letsencrypt* got an email notifying that the certificate will expire in a few days. However, the problem is that this is about a certificate he regularly replaces by auto-renewing it. It is not solved since there exists situations where a reminder is still worthwhile, even though a replacement certificate has been issued. One obvious heuristic suggested by the developers is to check each of the names on the old certificate. If any publicly-accessible web sites are still using the old certificate, a reminder is definitely in order, whether or not a replacement cert has been issued. This doesn't solve the whole problem, but can be used in conjunction with other heuristics to reduce the number of false negatives without increasing the number of false positives.

**Stakeholder:** Developers, users

###10. Title: How to implement Letsencrypt acme challenge on AWS API Gateway? [(\#2439)](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2439)
**Description:**
The issue is about a user trying to setup an API Gateway that automatically renews his certificate. He managed to generate a certificate using *letsencrypt* by spinning up an instance. When he tried to setup an endpoint *example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge* he couldn't find any *ode.js* code that will return the appropriate response. The problem was solved by a developer by giving a link about the ACME specification draft, sample code and libraries related.

Integrators
===========================
- [pde](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/created_by/pde)
- [bmw](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pulls/bmw)

According to the definition posted by by Georgios Gousios, the integrator must act to assure the quality of project by communicating modification requirements to the original contributors. Two developers listed below are responsible to merge pull requests and respond to contributors, no matter the pull requests are accepted or denied.


###Challenge of Integrators
1. The volume of incoming contributions is quite large. Given that the project is very active which receives a new pull request approximately every 3 hours, it is a huge workload for the integrators to test all of them and check the source codes. In addition to the integration of the project, they also have other works to do, which makes time a prior challenge.
2. Maintaining quality is also a major issue. Let's Encrypt is designed to be part of the certificate infrastructure which requires very high quality codes. Considering that the project has over 150 contributors, some of them are not so experienced and their coding styles differ. As a result, maintaining quality (making sure Let's Encrypt can work efficiently and the codes are easy to read) becomes a big challenge.

###Merge Strategies
1. All the pull requests have to pass the Travis test before merging into the master. Travis CI provides continuous integration service to build and test software projects hosted at Github. In this way, integrators can transit a great amount of his/her own work to the quality evaluation tools like Travis.
2. The project fit is a prominent factor for the integrators to decide whether to accept a contribution. Commits which add new but unneeded features to the project, for example, will be rejected by the integrators.
3. The integrators interact actively with the committers by for example, pointing out the potential reasons why the Travis test fails, giving guidance on how to modify the code and complimenting on their work. It helps inspire and encourage the contributors.
4. Higher priority is given to the pull requests relevant to the current opening issues. Since such issues usually address the critical problems such as bugs and user’s requirements for the new features, it helps improve the efficiency to maintain an active project like Let's Encrypt by prioritizing the pull requests in this way.

Context View
===========================
###System scope and Responsibilities

The responsibility of Let's Encrypt includes a series functions provided by the system for users.

- users can register certificate for their server
- users can revoke certificate
- users can create their own account  
- users can modify their profile
- users can turn on/off the notice of expiring date of certificate 
- users can choose which ACME solution to use

Let's Encrypt is a software concerning network security. Its functions are surely about that. However, what is different is that, it also cares about user experience, the full automation and easy use both highlight this.

###Entities, data and interfaces

####Entities and Interfaces

There're ten entities for Let's Encrypt. 
First, the development of Let's Encrypt is based on GitHub platform. Second, Python is identified as the only language dependency.
Third, the community, Freenode, is refered as the platform that developers communicate on. Fourth, as an authority,  Let's Encrypt must be qualified with root certificate, which is provided by IdenTrust. Fifth, the release is based on the Python Package Index (PYPI).  Sixth, Let's Encrypt extends its support of different servers by adding plugins including Apache, Nginx and Webroot. Seventh, the test part is extended by test tools, Tox and Travis CI online test system. Eighth, the operating system is another entity including a series Unix-ish Operating Systems like Arch, Debian, FreeBSD, etc. Ninth, the users are a large number of websites including blueboard.cz, checkdcmain. Finally, competitors are other softwares based on ACME.

####Impact of the System on Environment

The impact of system on environment concerns about the dependencies of other system on Let's Encrypt and other systems decommissions and data migration. Let's Encrypt can be used as a plugin embedded in other certificate system, thus the performance of such system will depend on Let's Encrypt. Since Let's Encrypt is still deveoping and incomplete, there is no system decommissions because of it. However, because it is free and automatic, it does form a big threat for its competitors. Finally, Let's Encrypt is software independently developed by ISRG. Their code and data including its protocols, plugins and client are all original.
