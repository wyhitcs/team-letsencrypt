#Chapter Outline
##Abstract
Letâ€™s encrypt is a software which aims to help you automatically apply Digital certificates and install/renew those certificates. 
In this chapter, we will first introduce some necessary knowledge to you e.g. what is Digital Certificate, what is ACME.
After that, we will give you a brief instruction on view and perspectives of letsencrypt: the context view, development view, deployment view, variability perspectives.

##Plan and current status:
1.	We have finished the first version of Context View, Development View and Variability Perspectives.
2.	We plan to add Deployment View and Evolution Perspectives for our chapter
3.	The Context View, Development View and Variability Perspectives are still in first version, hence they need to be revised.
