#Chapter Outline
##Abstract
Letâ€™s encrypt is a software which aims to help you automatically apply Digital certificates and install/renew those certificates. 
In this chapter, we will first introduce some necessary knowledge to you e.g. what is Digital Certificate, what is ACME.
After that, we will give you a brief instruction on the views and perspectives of Let's Encrypt: the Context View, Development View, Deployment View, Variability Perspectives and Evolution Perspectives.

##Plan and current status:
1.	We have finished the first version of Context View, Development View, Deployment View, Variability Perspectives and Evolution Perspectives.
2.	The content are still in first version, hence they need to be revised.
3.	We have made a little contribution to Let's Encrypt project and further contribution is planned and in progress.
