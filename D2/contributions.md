#Contribution Plan
Thought Let's Encrypt is still developing and includes a number of bugs or errors that need a solution, it is difficult to contribute to the project currently since the it is technically complicated. However we do have a plan relating to the problem described in development view. In future weeks, we will work on this and try to make some contributions.
##Problem overview
Currently, when the clients encounter error, it won't show 'trace back' information to users. It simply crashes without any response to inform users what actually happens.  
##Plan
This problem is already an issue [#2114](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2114) posted in the discussion board. But nobody replies to it by now. We plan to solve this problem. The 'client' package is the potential target that we will work on. After learning its code and layout, we will try to make an improvement. We want to apply an working branches for it and then we can launch our pull request. requests.
