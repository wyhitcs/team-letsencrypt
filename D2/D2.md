#Introduction

The development view describes the architecture that supports the software development process. The development view communicates the aspects of the architecture of interest to stakeholders from the building, testing, maintaining and enhancing the project(Nick, 2012). Based on this, the following article shows the common design model, module structure model and code line model of Let's Encrypt which give a technical overview of whole project. To learn more details, each model is attached with complete descrption. In addition, technical debt of the project and coresponding solution or plan are described at the end of report.

#Common Design Model

##Common Processing

- **Instruction parser**: 
The parser analyzes the received instructions with a preset procedure. Parsing users' input is considered to be a common process because 1) many modules rely on user inputs to determine their following actions 2) the parsing functions are similar in different modules. Hence, the parsers should be put in a module. In fact, all codes relevant with parser functions lie in the file *letsencrypt-auto* and *cli.py*.

- **ACME Objects**: 
To implement ACME Protocol, letsencyrpt contains some ACME Object such as ACME account and ACME Exceptions. Those Objects are used almost everywhere in letsencrypt. When the user wants to request an account, for example, an account Object is created and returned. Scuh account will later be used when a certificate needs to be requested or renewed. Therefore, all ACME Objects are wrapped in a module so that they can easily be called and maintained.

- **Configuration**:
Configuration Object is "a bag of variables" which are used by almost all the other modules. For instance, the user might want to register his/her information like "I have a domain name abc.com; my account is xxxxx; my email is xxxx@gmail.com; my private key stores in xxxxx; please give me a certificate for that domain name". By passing a configuration Object containing these attributes, it enables letsencrypt to automatically obtain, renew and revoke the certificate. Since many modules need to use the configuration objects to pass paramters, the configuration objects (as well as some functions) are wrapped in a module.

##Standard Design Approaches
The most important component of letsencrypt is plugin, there are 4 major kinds of plugin: User Interface (UI), Configurator, Authenticator, Installer. The leaders of this project use interfaces to standardlize the contributions from contributors.
The interfaces available for implementation of plugins are defined in [interfaces.py](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/master/letsencrypt/interfaces.py) and [plugins/common.py](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/master/letsencrypt/plugins/common.py#L34). The plugins must implement one of the four interfaces:

 - **Configurator**:  This component is used to automatically change configuration for different purposes. For example, if the user wants to                       change the folder to store certificates, configurations need to be changed with the help of a corresponding                              configurator.  Considering that different configurators are for different uses, letencrypt allows                           the contributors to write their own configurator which has to implement the corresponding interface.

 - **IDisplay**:  This plugin implements bindings to alternative UI libraries. Letsencrypt allows contributors to write their own UI which has to implement IDisplay.

 - **Authenticators**: It proves the client deserves a certificate for some domain name by solving challenges received from ACME server.                         For different types of challenges (e.g. simple HTTP challenge, DVSNI challenge), different                                   Authenticators are needed. Letsencrypt allows contributors to construct new authenticators which have to                 implement Authenticators Interfaces.

 - **Installer**: It setups the certificate in a server and possibly tweaks the security configuration to make it reliable and secure. For different Web Server in users' machines, different Installers are needed. It is allowed to construct your own                          Installer which has to implement Installer Interface.
 
 
##Standardlization of Testing
There are two types of tests: Unit Test and Intergration Test.
 - **Unit Test**: 
 Unit Test in letsencrypt aims to check whether the code style is compatiable with the required style. There are two files related to Unit Test: *pep8* and *tox.ini*. The Test can run off-line by developers.

- **Integration Test**: 
Integration Test is to test whether letsencrypt works well with boulder (a software runs in Certificate Authority which generate SSL/TLS). It is an online test running automatically to test a pull request. The module corresponding to Intergration Test is Travis CI.


#Module Structure Model

![ModuleStructure](https://github.com/delftswa2016/team-letsencrypt/blob/master/D2/module.structure.png)

The UML component diagram below gives an overview of module structure. Each package means a code module and arrow shows intermodule dependencies(Nick, 2012).

The first layer which is also the closest layer to users offers friendly UI for common clients to set up their own certificates. And the command way is also possible for developers to contribute to the project. 

Receiving commands from upper layer, the coordinator module tries to check the compatibility to ensure the job can be done in certain environment. After that, the commands are parsed by parser and functions offered in next layer are recalled.

As the core layer of whole project, the third layer offers important functions to complete tasks. ACME protocol is a protocol that a certificate authority (CA) and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance. The package contains a series of codes to complete this task. Challenge module represents automatic module to finish the challenge provided by CA. JSON Web Key (JWK) module offers a cryptographic key in this data structure.  Besides, Let’s Encrypt has a plugin architecture to facilitate support for different webservers, other TLS servers, and operating systems. Currently, general webservers like Apache and Nginx are supported.

There’s no doubt that all previous code is based on python library which is included the bottom layer. In addition, OpenSSL, a software library to be used to secure communications against eavesdropping or to ascertain the identity of the party at the other end, is also the base of authentication process .

#Codeline Model

In this section, code structure of letsencrypt will be explored. Build, Integration, Test and Release Approach also matters a lot in understanding the project organization. In addition, Technical Debt is also analyzed.

##Coding Style

The developers of Let's Encrypt follow the **Google Python Style Guide**, And use **Sphinx-style** for documentation. 'pylint' is used to check coding style.
```
def foo(arg):
    """Short description.

    :param int arg: Some number.

    :returns: Argument
    :rtype: int

    """
    return arg
```
##Build, Integration and Test Approach

To provide developers a convenient environment and also protect project source version, Let's Encrypt has an offical workflow for building, integrating and testing. 

###Build

Let's Encrypt supports multiple operating systems. Users can install client according to their requirements. However, developers should have their own local copies based on their platform and run the client in developer mode from local tree for technical test.  

###Integration

To contribute to Let's Encrypt project, developers have to follow the strict integration process made by project team.

- Developers can firstly find open issues in the github issue tracker or post new issues for their own idea.

- Then developers start to work on the problem, post a comment to let others know and seek feedback on the plan where appropriate.

- Once the developer gets a working branch, he/she can open a pull request. All changes in pull request must pass complete test. Generally it is sufficient to open a pull request and let Github and Travis run integration tests for you. However, if developers prefer to run tests, they can use Vagrant, using the Vagrantfile in Let’s Encrypt’s repository. 

- Let's Encrypt integrator will review the pull request and make a decision to merge or not.

###Test

Before merging the changes in pull requests, all of them must have thorough unit test coverage, pass Let's Encrypt's integration tests, and be compliant with the coding style. This is done by popular online testing platform Travis CI. 
And developers can also do their own test before posting a request. Tox is recommended as official tools for running a full set of test like config file parsing test. For debugging, ipdb is introduced to execlude a series of faults.

##Release Process

Let's Encrypt release packages and upload them to PyPI (wheels and source tarballs).

- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/acme

- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/letsencrypt

- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/letsencrypt-apache

- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/letsencrypt-nginx

- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/letshelp-letsencrypt

The following scripts are used in the process:

- https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/master/tools/dev-release.sh

- https://gist.github.com/kuba/b9a3a2ca3bd35b8368ef

Let's Encrypt currently version as 0.0.0.devYYYYMMDD, and will change at GA time to the following scheme:

- 0.1.0

- 0.2.0dev for developement in master

- 0.2.0 (only temporarily in master)

- ...

Tracking issue for non-dev release scripts: https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/1185

##Configuration Management

To ensure repeatability and technical integrity, Let's encrypt define a configuration file. It is possible to specify configuration file with `letsencrypt-auto --config cli.ini` (or shorter `-c cli.ini`).
By default, the following locations are searched:

- `/etc/letsencrypt/cli.ini`

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/letsencrypt/cli.ini` (or `~/.config/letsencrypt/cli.ini` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set).

All flags used by the client can be configured, including RSA key size, registed e-mail address, specified domains which generate certificates for, text interface or ncurses, standalone authenticator, webroot authenticator.

#Technical Debt

The concept of technical debt refers to the accumulated consequences of the quick but dirty design into an evolving software program (Fowler, 2014). In other words, the danger occurs when people rush software by simply adding features into the program but never reflect their understanding of those features. As the “debt” accumulates, the complexity of maintaining the programs to reduce its deterioration to the whole software increases (Cunningham, 2011).

##Code Duplication

In issue [#383](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/383), code duplication exsits between apache and nginx plugins; and in issue [#698](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/383), [Dockerfile-dev](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/26c1f003d0d05397154fe63e1f452ed2148cfe75/Dockerfile-dev) and [Dockerfile](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/blob/26c1f003d0d05397154fe63e1f452ed2148cfe75/Dockerfile) also duplicated.

Duplicated code is code that has been produced by copying and then adapting existing code. Also known as “copy-and-paste development”, this strategy of producing code is frequently employed as a way of reusing software. 
On the first impression, code duplication seems to be a desirable approach to development as it is associated with reuse, implementation speed-up, and developer care. However, in the long term, code duplication implications can be very negative.
First of all, code duplication causes an increase in software size. Secondly, duplication has a direct influence on the difficulty of maintaining already developed code. Additionally, code-duplication can also be a sign of poor design, indicating that generic functionality has been not properly abstracted. Consequently, on long term, especially during the maintenance phase, code duplication is to be avoided.


##Documentation

For open source projects, the contribution of open source communities behind the huge development of the project is very evident. So it is very important that a transparent documentation system is followed in such community projects. Without proper documentation it is very difficult for other developers to understand the code developed by any user and to reuse the code or make it more efficient.Unfortunately, for Let's Encrypt, they do not provide a well-structured documentation for developers. There are 59 issuses labeled `documentation`. No architecture and module information, which makes understanding of how the project works and how the module connect with each other difficult to understand, which makes it difficult for developers not in their team to contribute to the project. In addition, insufficient documentation may also cause troubles for users.


##User Friendly

A good user experience is important for the software, and a crucial first step in achieving this is deploying a user-friendly interface. For Let's Encrypt, user mostly interact with the software when deploy `letsencrypt` for their own website, this progress in done mainly in terminal. This process is not user friendly enough.

- issue [#2498](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2498): The client will display all the changes to users. Users can't specify how many lines to show on their screen. The developer choose to ignore this unresonalable fact to save some time, but now they have to pay their time back. The issue has been closed and they add a parameter to the function to enable specifying how many lines to show

- issue [#2114](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2114): Now, when the letsencrypt-auto fails, the client won't show what exactly fails to the client. Most programs have trace back features while letsecnrypt doesn't. I believe it is the developers who choose to ignore such needs of the client, just for convenience, they choose to do it quick and dirty. It is also a technical debt which they have to pay back.


##How developers deal with technical debt

For technical debt, developers always find it via Issues, discuss it and try to find a better solution to fix it. For the technical debt and related issues we mentioned above [#2155](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2155), [#2498](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2498) and [#2114](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2114) they use this kind of method to manage their technical debt. 
- Code Duplication: Recent advances in static code analysis and hardware performance made possible tool-based localization of code duplication in industrial contexts. 
For developers, they could use this kind of tools to detect duplicates and then improved by sharing common util functions (as they did in [#382](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/pull/382)).

- Documentation: The developers are professionals who may not be aware of the not sufficient documentation, but they are willing to fix it when users make an issue on the github as what they did in issue [#2216] (https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2216) and [#2271](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2271).

#Conclusions

As shown above, the let's encrypt project have good common design model, good standard design approaches. However, there are many drawbacks. First, let's encrypt has a crappy developer documents. As a new comer it is very hard to see the whole picture of the project, let alone contribute to it. Second, the client is not user friendly, and it is also hard to install (it is designed to be easy to install, but in fact it usually crash without any trace back information, that is some kinds of technical debts, the developers still have no idea to thoroughly solve it.

#Contribution Plan

Thought Let's Encrypt is still developing and includes a number of bugs or errors that need a solution, it is difficult to contribute to the project currently since the it is technically complicated. However we do have a plan relating to the problem described in development view. In future weeks, we will work on this and try to make some contributions.

##Problem overview

Currently, when the clients encounter error, it won't show 'trace back' information to users. It simply crashes without any response to inform users what actually happens.  

##Plan

This problem is already an issue [#2114](https://github.com/letsencrypt/letsencrypt/issues/2114) posted in the discussion board. But nobody replies to it by now. We plan to solve this problem. The 'client' package is the potential target that we will work on. After learning its code and layout, we will try to make an improvement. We want to apply an working branches for it and then we can launch our pull request. requests.
