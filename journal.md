#Week 1
We choose 'Letsencrypt' as our research project. The Let's Encrypt Client is a fully-featured, extensible client for the Let's Encrypt CA that can automate the tasks of obtaining certificates and configuring webservers to use them. For its practicability, the project is quite hot recently which attracts lots of programmers to contribute to. And this also inspires us to research the project or even improve it.
The task for the first week is planned as follow:
- Attending lectures
- Picking the project *letsencrypt*: letsencrypt is a newly developed, highly active and interesting project, which makes it a good choice.
- Getting to know the project in more depth: browsing the readme file, documentation and website to get familiar with the project.
- Learning GitHub: Since not all team members are familiar with the GitHub, we will follow the tutorial online and master it as soon as possible.
- Learning encryption technique: Our project is about encryption. Getting the main idea about it and learning its common structure will benifit.
